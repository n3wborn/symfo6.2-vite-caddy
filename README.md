# Symfony 6.2 Vite Caddy


1. What ?

    - Symfony 6.2 based on [Symfony Docker](https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker)

2. Why ?

    - to replace my previous apache/nginx by Caddy for Symfony projects
    - to add a Node container to Symfony Docker
    - to replace Webpack Encore by Vite (using "pentatrion/vite-bundle")
    - to have a light/fast asset/template builder with HMR
    - to have something ready for dev and prod
    - to play and learn !
    - and surely more I don't think of right now

## Install

```sh
clone https://github.com/n3wborn/symfo6.2-vite-caddy
cd symfo6.2-vite-caddy
make build && make up
```
